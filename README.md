# Obsidian Smart Links

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that lets you define custom "smart" links which will be auto-linked when reading documents.

If you're used to writing in an environment that auto-links certain strings and don't want to build new habits, this will help with that. E.g. `T12345` in phabricator, or `#4324` in github.

## Credits

The reading-mode code was heavily influenced by [Obsidian GoLinks](https://github.com/xavdid/obsidian-golinks) -- this plugin is (arguably) a customizable superset of that one's functionality.
